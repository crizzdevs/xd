1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming is a style of programming that involves lumping data and actions into objects that organize software design rather than functions and logic.

2. List the Four Pillars of OOP and briefly describe each
• Encapsulation
Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit or “object,” and hiding the internal details from the outside world.

• Inheritance
Inheritance is the process of one class inheriting properties and methods from another class in Java. This allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (parent class).

• Polymorphism
Polymorphism means “many forms.” It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The functions behave differently depending on the implementations.

• Abstraction
Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

3. Why is code quality important in OOP?
Code quality is crucial in OOP for making robust, maintainable, and scalable software by ensuring the code is readable, efficient, and less error-prone, which reduces development cost and improves development speed and readability.
